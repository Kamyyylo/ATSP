# Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem

Data input is taken from files<br />
**Examplary file (First number is the size of the matrix):**<br /><br />
6<br />
 0 20 30 31 28 40<br />
30  0 10 14 20 44<br />
40 20  0 10 22 50<br />
41 24 20  0 14 42<br />
38 30 32 24  0 28<br />
50 54 60 52 38  0<br /><br />
To solve ATSP i used **Dynamic Programming**, **Brute-Force method**, **TabuSeach(To find closest value for many cities)** and **Genetic Algorithm**

**TabuSearch** has 3 definition of neighborhood and a diversification(criticalEvent).
**Genetic Algorithm** has 2 definition od mutation and one crossover method

Program has userfriendly interface to test and learn this two algorithms:
